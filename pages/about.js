                This was made to help you build fully developed business
                concepts with ease.
              </h3>
              Creating a complete business concept is tough. There‚Äôs the high
              level branding; such as a catchy name, slogan, and company vision.
              But there is also the more technical biz dev stuff like deciding
              on marketing channels and determining cost structure.
              <p>
                These areas are incredibly important to describe in detail. The
                catch is, they require a knowledge of several different business
                areas. It takes time and effort to build that knowledge base,
                and this time and effort takes you away from doing what you want
                most; networking and building your actual business. Enter,
                Canvascat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Canvascat needs just four short descriptions (industry, target
                customers, product/service info and key benefits) to build your
                entire business model canvas, business identity and a full SWOT
                analysis to get you started up the right way. All with a click.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use Canvascat to:
                <ul>
                  <li>Give you an initial business concept</li>
                  <li>Refine and mature an existing concept</li>
                  <li>Perform a SWOT analysis </li>
                  <li>Create your elevator pitch </li>
                  <li>
                    Help you build a vision of the future of your business
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  And so much more. Simply click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù tab at the top of
                  the screen to get started, and build the purrrrfect business
                  for youüòâ
